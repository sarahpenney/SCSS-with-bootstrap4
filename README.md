## PRACTICE USING BOOTSTRAP4



### NOTES ABOUT THE PROJECT

Showcasing AngularJS, Bootstrap4 and Sass.

Had not used Bootstrap4 before so took a while to get used to it. Showed small samples of Angular to show I can use this, getting data from a file, using data in the html etc..
Small TODO's in the project showing what I would have done with more time and small sass changes to be made.
