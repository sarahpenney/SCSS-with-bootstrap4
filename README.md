Test for Junior Front End

### NOTES ABOUT THE PROJECT

The project as it stands is approximately half way finished. 
There are little TODO notes in the code but some things are obvious.
As you will see there is a lot of styling yet to be done.
Thought I would get what I have done over to you ASAP so you can see.
I had around 24 hours free to work on this so I used Angular which I am most familiar with and tried to use Bootstrap4.
If I had more time over the weekend I would have put all the content in a JSON dummy data file and extracted from there.
I would have made a lot of the elements different directives to keep everything neat and seperate and easy to find.
