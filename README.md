Test for Junior Front End

### NOTES ABOUT THE PROJECT

The project as it stands is approximately half way finished. 
As you will see there is a lot of styling yet to be done.
Thought I would get what I have done over to you ASAP so you can see.
I had around 24 hours free to work on this so I used Angular which I am most familiar with and tried to use Bootstrap4.
