Test for Junior Front End

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Notes before Installing

The project as it stands is approximately half way finished. As you will see there is a lot of styling yet to be done.
Thought I would get what I have done over to you ASAP so you can see what I have done.
As I had around 24 hours to work on this I used Angular which I am most familiar with and tried to use Bootstrap4.
